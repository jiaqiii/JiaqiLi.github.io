## Whcih pair of curly Bracket is missing one? 

That moment you found out it's a missing curly bracket after looking into your code for the longest time to find 
that syntax error, ever had a problem like that before? looking for  one missing bracket is a pain in the neck 
especially if your code is anything longer than one page, try look for the missing bracket in spaghetti code with

horrible style/format, that thing come back and haunt you like a nightmare. Why? Because going through code line 
by line to find something is just so much harder and slower than replying on the coding pattern to find a certain 
thing. The tidiness of coding is the key to make life easier.<img class="ui tiny left circular floated image" src="../images/beachlife.jpg">

Many IDEs or online coding environments provides formatting clean up function, such as Eclipse provides function 
to tidy up Java code, and JsFiddle tidies up code in Javascript. Since I am currently using Javascript in Intellij, 
I am using ESlint to do the tidy-check. Still very new to this tool, I am in the process of figuring out if I like 
it. The common thing about a lot of tidy-tools besides they put code in patterned style is that a lot people found 
it disturbing when the tidy-tools won’t do a custom format. Tidy-tools sure helps in keeping a consistent pattern in 
coding style, it makes code very good looking and easy to read. It is also very common to hear reviews such as “I want
each of my bracket to have a whole line instead of starting my first bracket in the end of a line of code”, or “I want
my functions to be in multiple lines instead of one line when I use the arrow sign”, etc. It’s too common to hear this
kind of review because most tidy-tools tidy up codes in its preset format.

Regarding the amazing benefit a tidy-tool could bring us, I can never say I dislike a tidy-tool. But I have full 
empathy on how people are bothered by the inflexible of its formatting, because nobody likes tidy-tools to randomly
switch up a coding style that had already been set up.
