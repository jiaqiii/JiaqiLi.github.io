JavaScript is fun so far! Reason for that? I code in C most of the time before coming in to
contact with Javascript. Computer languages are sometimes like people, I would compare C to 
a person that is very specific in everything, and JavaScript would be someone who is very relax
on everything. It's easier to code in JavaScript since there is less rule in the syntax of this
languages. Comparing C and Javascrit, I enjoy coding in C and also learned a lot from it, but I 
had so much fun with Javascript.

The athletic software engineering style that we did in class is great. I have only done it once so
far, so I would need a few more trial in order to give it an objective evaluation. So far, the WOD
is pretty nerve-racking, especially I am so new to this Language, and not familiar with WOD excersice.
However, everyone in the class feel the same way, that turns my stress into an excitement that I feel
like taking on challenges that is fun. I am therefore looking forward to the future WODs!
