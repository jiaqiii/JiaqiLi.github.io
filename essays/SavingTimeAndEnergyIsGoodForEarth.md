#Why "Good Question" needs to be a topic

Nowadays, with a better education system, different academic fields are growing. More people are 
invoveld in different fields means more collaborating oppotunities, which leads to the importance of succinct 
communication. Most of the factors that contribute to a qualilty communication points to the efficiency in
time and energy of a communication. In another word, did all parties do their reseach before bringing up problems
to discuss, and if they elaborated the problem in clear and precise words.                    


#STFW = Search The Fucking Web
As Raymond's article mentioned, one example that demonstrate a party that is not respecting other's time and energy, 
is if someone asking questions that could be easily answered with a bit input of effort, such as reading a mannual 
or searching on google. By not doing so, it defect the quality of any communication, leads to the slowing down of a 
working progress, and therefore bad for a development of any project.

#Volume is not precision --Raymond

-->This example demonstrates a question that is long and unclear. There is far more information provided then what is needed.
To make a question clear and succinct in order to respect other's time and energy, it is important to provide a minimal 
test case that precisely demonstrate parts that are relavent to the problem, and leave out the rest. 

#A good demonstration

-->This example illustrate a well appreciated question, because it provides minimal test cases that are easy to read. It is clear and 
precise when both the actual result and the desired result of a test case is demonstrated. Showing one's tested result also
demonstrates one's effort, that one had attempted to solve a problem.
