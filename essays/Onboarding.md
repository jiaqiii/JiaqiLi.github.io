# About Me

I have always been interested in software developing, and TechFolio is a great project
for learning,and experiencing different software tools and problems encountered during
the building process.

## About Techfolio

In the past, when it came to creating professional portfolios, obstacles often come
alone such as confusion on designing a good looking template, or not having an easy
platform to edit the portfolio. These problems could all really use some helps from
a good editing platform, such as Techfolio. While setting up the binary Techfolio,
I had a hard time making the content show when clicking on the bio menu, so under
my instructor's suggestion, I edited this project in the local environment instead.
The process of setting up the local environment is quick. I encountered a couple
git errors, but the console is clear and instructional. Something I could think of
to improve Techfolio experience could be adding new features under the menu tabs,
I would be interested in doing so.
