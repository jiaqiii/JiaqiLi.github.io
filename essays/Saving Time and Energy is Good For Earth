time and energy of a communication. In another word, did all parties do their reseach before bringing up problems
to dicuss, and if they elaborated the problem in a clear and precise words. As Raymond's article mentioned, one
example that demonstrate a party that is not respecting other's time and energy, is if someone asking questions that
