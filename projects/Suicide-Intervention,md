This Suicide Intervention certification courses that I participated in a couple years ago was a 2-day training 
on the subject. During the training, we learned suicidal signs to be detected, according actions that could be 
applied in steps, and post-checkups techniques that could be applied after an initial resolving of an suicidal 
attempt.

During the training, I learned to apply knowledge from psychology classes I took into interventing a suicidal 
attempt. My study in abnormal psychology helped me to better understand a suicidal behavior, and thus allow me
to approach a victim apporpriately.

I completed my Associate Degree in Psychology a few years back. This course was one of the remarkable courses 
that I took, it taught me the way to approach people who need help and support, which could be everyone and anyone.
