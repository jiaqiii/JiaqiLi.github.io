In this event, I interpretated the whole presentation from english to Chinese simultaneously. I also helped out in the Q&A session
after the presentation.

Since the translation is simultaneous, it practiced my prompt responding to translating sentences, and my flexibility on handling 
unpredicted situations. I also learned a lot information on new beauty products on the market.

This event happened back when I was in high school, it challenged my comfortability since I had to be in the spotlight and also had
to repond very quickly to every sentences in the presentation. I learned a lot from this experience, and I walked away with a great 
paycheck.
